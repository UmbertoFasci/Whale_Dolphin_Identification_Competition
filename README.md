## Overview

For the purpose of showcasing my workflow, this readme will outline the process of going through the [Happy Whales and Dolphins Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/happy-whale-and-dolphin/overview) Kaggle competition. For more overview information regarding this competition please visit its overview webpage which can be found on its kaggle page.

The data in this competition contains images of over **15,000** unique individual marine mammals from **30** different species collected from **28** different research organizations. The individuals have been manually identified and given an `individual_id`. The task of this competition is to correctly identify these individuals in images. In modelling terms, this `individual_id` value is the target variable for prediction. 

|**Files**   | **Description**|
|--------|---------|
|train_images/| A folder containing the training images.|
|train.csv| Provides the `species` and the `individual_id` for each of the training images.|
|test_images/| A folder containing the test images; these are the images which the task of this competition is centered on. The task is to predict `individual_id` and should be predicted as `new_individual`.|
|sample_submission.csv| A sample submission file in the correct format.|
